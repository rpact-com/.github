## RPACT

We help you to implement and establish R/Shiny in your business. With our enterprise software development services, we offer professional services that cover the entire life cycle of an R package, incl. validation, i.e., documented testing and verification of the functionality; creation of a comprehensive validation documentation (compliant to FDA/GxP guidelines).

Furthermore, we offer training, and consultancy in confirmatory adaptive designs using the R software. You, e.g., can book a [rpact](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rpact) package training at a company site; can ask for access to extended manuals, best practice descriptions and additional examples; can order the implementation of frequent workflows and processes with the "rpact" package.
